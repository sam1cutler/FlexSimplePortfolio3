            <p>I'm an aspiring software developer based in Seattle, WA. Previously, I have:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Worked as an <b>educator</b>, working with college students, high school students, middle school students, and adults, in the United States and China.</li>
              <li>Done <b>hands-on biology research</b>, designing and executing molecular biology experiments investigating the HIV immune response, stem cell development, lung cancer tumorigenesis, and DNA structure.</li>
              <li>Used a <b>broad range of technical tools</b> - including Python, Bash, and R - to analyze large bioinformatics data sets, create publication-quality data figures, and communicate scientific results in journal articles and conferences presentations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Through this diverse set of professional experiences, I have developed great skills in problem-solving, troubleshooting, team collaboration, and communicating complex topics. I will apply all of these skills, along with a rapidly-developing programming ability, to any technical challenges I face as a software developer.</p>

          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>I earned my PhD in molecular and cellular biology from the University of Washington, in <a href="https://research.fhcrc.org/tsukiyama/en.html">the lab of Dr. Toshi Tsukiyama, located at Seattle's Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center</a>. While conducting my PhD research, I used a lot of Python, Bash, and R, and found that I loved programming. In particular, I found it immensely gratifying to use R to create beautiful, publication-quality figures that looked just how I wanted; to write Python scripts that could efficiently analyze huge, whole-genome data sets; and to create Bash scripts that could transform three hours of painstaking, repetitive typing at the command line into a simple process of "run one script, go have lunch, and come back to folders full of neatly analyzed data"! Based largely on that experience, I am now extremely excited to be pursuing a career in software development.</p>
          
          <p>Services I can provide to your team:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Creation of <b>HTML pages</b>, incorporating jQuery DOM manipulation, flexbox layouts, responsive navigation, and API requests.</li>
            <li>Creation of <b>React</b> apps.</li>
            <li>Help <b>communicating complex, technical information</b>, whether translating customer needs into actionable coding expectations, or translating technical features of code into customer-appropriate user guidelines.</li>
            <li>Writing <b>Python scripts</b> capable of analyzing biological data, such as genome-wide sequencing results.</li>
            <li>Writing <b>Bash scripts</b> to allow for radically more efficient running of bioinformatics analytical pipelines.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Outside of my passions for programming, science, and teaching, I love to spend as much time as possible in the outdoors, in particular:</p>
